description: AI-powered documentation generation and validation pipeline for the Jac language.
---

## Overview

Built a documentation generation pipeline that compresses 100+ MB of Jac language documentation into a validated 21 KB reference using deterministic extraction and a single LLM assembly pass. Achieves 100% code block validation rate with zero hallucinated syntax.

## Work

- Designed a 4-stage pipeline (fetch, extract, assemble, validate) with subprocess isolation and WebSocket progress broadcasting
- Built a deterministic extractor that classifies code blocks across 26 construct types using Lark AST parsing with regex fallback, scoring and selecting the best 3 examples per construct
- Implemented validation against 39 critical syntax patterns with `jac check` compiler verification and cross-referencing against official docs
- Developed a FastAPI + React dashboard with Monaco editor for real-time pipeline execution and source management

## Stack

Python, FastAPI, React, Lark, OpenRouter API (Claude), SQLite, WebSockets

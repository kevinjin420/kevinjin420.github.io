## Overview

Built the official website for the University of Michigan Mars Rover Team. Features interactive 3D rover model visualization using Three.js and URDF loaders, scroll-driven camera transitions, and GSAP-powered animations throughout.

## Work

- Designed an interactive scroll-driven 3D experience for the About page with horizontal scrolling through 5 team branches, each rendering URDF and GLTF models with wireframe visualization
- Built a home page with terminal-styled hero, typed.js animations, and scroll-triggered GSAP fade-in sequences
- Implemented a rovers showcase page with historical rover cards, modal slideshows, and Lenis smooth scrolling
- Set up the build pipeline with GLTF Transform for Draco 3D compression and Astro image optimization

## Stack

Astro, React, Three.js, React Three Fiber, GSAP, Lenis, TailwindCSS, TypeScript

## Overview

Built a 5-inch FPV drone from scratch, learning to solder components, design vibration-dampening housings in Fusion360, and configure flight software via serial ports and LUA scripting.

## Details

The build involved selecting and sourcing individual components (frame, motors, ESC, flight controller, VTX, camera), soldering everything together, and designing custom 3D-printed mounts for the action camera with vibration dampening. Flight controller configuration was done through Betaflight with custom LUA scripts for OSD and parameter tuning via the radio transmitter.

## Skills

Soldering, CAD (Fusion360), LUA, Betaflight, Video Production

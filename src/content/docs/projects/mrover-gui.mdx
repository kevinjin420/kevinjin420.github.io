## Overview

Teleoperations Lead for the Michigan Mars Rover Student Project Team. Responsible for the frontend and backend systems that allow operators to control the rover during competition.

## Work

- Redesigned the teleoperation backend from Django to FastAPI with 6 async WebSocket endpoints and REST API, integrating ROS2 pub/sub messaging for bidirectional real-time control at 60Hz
- Implemented MessagePack binary serialization across the Vue.js frontend and Python backend, reducing network latency by 44% and bandwidth by 36% for command/telemetry transmission
- Built a THREE.js-based 3D rover visualization tool rendering URDF models for real-time inverse kinematics target positioning and teleoperation spatial awareness

## Stack

Vue.js, FastAPI, Python, C++, ROS2, MessagePack, THREE.js, WebSockets
